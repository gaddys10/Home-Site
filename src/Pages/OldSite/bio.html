                    My name is Syrus Maurice Gaddy.
                    <br><br> 
                    As of May 2016, I am a Computer Science graduate with a minor in Mathematics.<br><br>
                    Objectively, I am a champion of the Inaugural Swarmathon Robotics Physical Challenge. In 2015, I recieved an Honorable Mention in the Regional Intercollegiate Programming contest hosted by IBM at Duke University, reaching the top half of participants. I am also self taught web designer who began working with HTML & Adobe Photoshop in middle school. I have sold computers for Best Buy and I have done professional troubleshooting with Apple. During my time at Fayetteville State University I almost single-handedly recorded, edited, and produced a 10-minute documentary for Fayetteville Urban Ministries' Executive Director, for which I recieved an A grade.<br><br>
                    But really? I am an artist who is attempting to use technology as a medium to express ideas and to apply them on a large scale to benefit humanity. Currently, I am still in my early stages of development. What that really means is that I am learning everything I can every day to gain the skills I need to combine my left and right-brained abilities to produce something unique for the world and loving every moment of it. 
                    <br><br>
                    I am currently dedicating my summer to learning as much as I could to prepare for my desired job in the software engineering field. This fall, I plan to put all of my IT, programming, and scripting abilities to the test in my first full-time job post-graduation. In the future, I plan to pursue a Masters Degree in Artificial Intelligence and a Ph.D. in Robotics.
